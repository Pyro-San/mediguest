"    <p>This project is a scheduling app. At its core are events that "
"constitute a start and end date implemented via two DateTimeFields together "
"with a some meta datax such as title, description, etc.</p>\n"
"    <p>To make it more user friendly there is the idea of EventRelation "
"which links generic objects and an Event object.  The idea is that you will "
"keep more information about the event in these relations such as who is "
"authorized to view them. It could be the case that User is linked to Event "
"to represent who is authorized to view the event, and also User is linked to "
"event to represent who is attending the event.</p>\n"
"    <p>The EventRelation has another field called distinction.  So in the "
"previous example we could add an EventRelation which links a User to an "
"Event with the distinction \"viewer\" and another EventRelation which links "
"a User to an Event with the distinction \"attendee.\"</p>\n"
