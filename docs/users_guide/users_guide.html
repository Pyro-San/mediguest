        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        <p>MediGuest is a powerful system for tracking all aspects of a company's
        guest management.  It is designed to make your life easier, by
        taking care of as much as possible automatically, and reducing risk
        of errors.</p>

        <h3>Overview</h3>

        <p>MediGuest is, essentially, a website.  You use it just like any other
        website, except that a shortcut will be provided on your desktop, so
        that you don't have to find the website first.  So, the general pattern
        of use is:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Go to MediGuest by opening the icon on your desktop.</li>
            <li>Log in</li>
            <li>Do your work</li>
            <li>Log out</li>
        </ol>

        <p>We'll cover &hash;3 in later sections, but let's get the
        login and logout out of the way first.</p>
