<h2>Parties</h2>

<p>This agreement is between the service user (hereinafter, "client") and {{ org_name }}
(hereinafter, {{ org_name }}, or "the organisation" }}.</p>


<h2>Authoritative records, and signing the agreement</h2>

<p>The computerised records are the authoritative records.  No notes made on printouts
are valid, except as a temporary step toward updating computerised records.</p>

<p>In order to facilitate thsi single, authoritative record, a log of signatures is kept
separately from individual printouts of this document.  That is, individual printouts of this
document <em>must not</em> be signed.</p>

<p>The signature log, the signature, and the date of signature therein, together with the
computerised records, kept up to date with computerised NTP time-keeping systems,
will constitute a historical record of what was agreed between the client
and {{ org_name }}, and when the agreement was made.  Printouts of records are made only
to facilitate reading by clients who may be unfamiliar with computers, or restricted in access
to the computer system's records.</p>

<p>It is <em>not</em> required that the client, nor that all staff members
and volunteers, fully understand these principles of authoritative documents and audit trails.
It is sufficient that staff members, volunteers, and service users understand that the computerised records
are the <em>official</em> records, and printouts, and handwritten updates to those printouts, are
<em>not</em> valid, until updated in the computerised records.</p>

<p>That is: clients, staff, and volunteers must understand that changed printouts are not being
signed: computer records are, and printouts simply represent them, as accurately as possible.</p>
